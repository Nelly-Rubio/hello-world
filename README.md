This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Nelly Rubio. I live in Tucson, AZ with my partner, who is also in this program. My bachelor's degree was in Geosciences. Currently, I am in New Mexico collecting soil samples in the middle of nowhere. I am excited to code in this class, hopefully I will be able to balance my long days in the field and my homework promptly.
